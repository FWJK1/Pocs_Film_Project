# Fitz
* improve README
* Label the ‘improved scrape books’ by what they scrape
* Delete/merge ‘Data Viz’ into something else 
* Anything with one or more copies can be deleted
* Not sure what ‘ipynb’ checkpoints exists for 
* Organize everything under ‘Code’ to a subfolder, same thing with Data
* Add markdowns to notebooks
* Maybe any code that hasn’t made any real results should be put into a separate folder, ‘Unfinished/defunct/future developments’.....
* I think everything in ‘Misc’ can just be deleted
* Not sure what the scraper cache is, but it’s a big folder so if we don’t need it that would be wonderful
* notes.ipynb’ can be deleted
* All of the data wrangling stuff could be put into a subfolder but probably fine to just label stuff with what it does to the formatting

# Jeremy
* Rename ‘Jeremy Unfinished Trope Stuff’ - maybe delete some stuff out of it like trope contamination, etc. 
* Add markdowns to notebooks
* work through "alien stuff," renaming for clarity and order
* where useful (doing something en masse versus looking closely), convert notebooks to .py scripts
