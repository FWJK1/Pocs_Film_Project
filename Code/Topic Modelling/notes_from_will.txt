## changing dimensions of UMAP in berttopic (maybe something like 5d clustering)
## look into the berttopic visualizer as well\
## seed UMAP with specific words or documents or serve as anchors
## different embeddings from different models; look into their functions
## potential metrics == topic perplexity 
## named entity recognition -- spacey 
## UMAP hyper-parameters
## playwright -- better than selenium!
