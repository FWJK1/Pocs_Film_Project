      " They did it, guys! I actually want to cry because they gave us a great movie of this franchise after all these years (I appreciatedPrometheusandAlien: Covenantbut they're not among my fav.) and I can say that it's as scary and terrifying as the first one directed by the master Ridley Scott. I loved how they handled all of it, the tension is great, the atmosphere is haunting and I personally loved the practical effect Alvarez decided to use. It seems a movie made in the 80s', in the best way possible.I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did. \n",
