1-Dimensional Thinking," The Nazgûl at the Fords of Bruinen. Instead of just riding back into the forest, they ride downstream where the wave is certain to catch them... because the water has distorted all sense of direction for them (hence why they were reluctant to cross in the first place).",,,,,,,,
Aborted Arc," Bilbo's departure from the Shire is an in-universe example. Bilbo's intention for his retirement was to retrace his and the Company of the Dwarves’ journey and revisit the familiar locales of his youth (Mirkwood, Lake-town, and Erebor). However, those travel plans were made before Bilbo relinquished the Ring (and without knowing it was actually responsible for his longevity). With it gone, Bilbo’s chronological age began catching up with him and he only made it as far as Rivendell before being forced to call it quits.",,,,,,,,
Achey Scars, Frodo Baggins receives a painful scar that nearly kills him . The Nazgûl confront him and his friends on Weathertop and attack them; it is in the ensuing battle that Frodo receives a wound from his enemy that will never fully heal .,,,,,,,,
"Action Film, Quiet Drama Scene"," The heartwarming and peaceful scenes of The Shire (especially in the Director's Cut), filled with laughter, friendship and happy children (what a warrior lays down his life to protect) is what makes us actually care whether or not Frodo and the Fellowship defeat the Lord of the Rings or not.",,,,,,,,
Actually Pretty Funny," When Gandalf arrives at Bag End and knocks on the front door, he expects a warm greeting from his old dear friend. Gandalf’s instead greeted by the Hobbit (who doesn’t realize who’s knocking) yelling through the closed door and going on a very Bilbo-esque tirade about visitors, well-wishers, and distant relations. Gandalf just stares at the door throughout all this before chuckling. Even 60 years after the Quest of Erebor , Bilbo is still Bilbo.",,,,,,,,
Adaptational Angst Upgrade, Gimli has a far more stoic reaction to Balin's fate in the book.,,,,,,,,
Adaptation Explanation Extrication," Tom Bombadil is cut from the film, along with the scene with where he rescues the hobbits from the Barrow-wights and takes their enchanted daggers which Merry uses to slay the Witch-king . Here, he uses an Elven dagger gifted by Galadriel which is never truly hinted or explained whether it's effective against the Witch-king of Angmar unless it's enchanted in a similar way with the books counterpart. Then again, it's a gift of Galadriel . Gandalf stops at Rohan in the first book before going to Rivendell, attempting to warn Theoden about Saruman's Face–Heel Turn — but Grima Wormtongue has already started poisoning his mind. This is eliminated from the film, so it's not explained how Gandalf is so up-to-date on what's been happening in Rohan.",,,,,,,,

Then again, it's a gift of Galadriel .",,,,,,,,
Face–Heel Turn," Rohan in the first book before going to Rivendell, attempting to warn Theoden about Saruman's Face–Heel Turn — but Grima Wormtongue has already started poisoning his mind. This is eliminated from the film, so it's not explained how Gandalf is so up-to-date on what's been happening in Rohan.",,,,,,,,
Adaptational Context Change," Galadriel's iconic introductory voice-over was originally spoken by Treebeard in the book, where he laments to Gandalf about the past. The film has Galadriel reminiscing about the history of the Ring. Sam says the exact same line to Frodo at the end of both the book and movie: ""Of course you are, and I'm coming with you!"" In the book, Frodo has just said, ""But I am going to Mordor!"", but in the movie the line is changed to ""I'm going to Mordor alone!"", which makes Sam's response a lot more humorous.",,,,,,,,
Adaptation Dye-Job," Boromir in is described as having dark hair. For the movies they gave him light brown, bordering on blond. note In the books, Boromir looks a lot like Aragorn (they're related). The director probably felt that this would look confusing on film. The elves of Lothlórien are shown to be uniformly blonde, though only elves with particularly strong Vanyar ancestry, such as Galadriel, have blonde hair in the books.",,,,,,,,
Adaptational Timespan Change," In the book, it's about seventeen years from Bilbo's farewell party to Gandalf's visit where the Ring-inscription is revealed, and a few more months before Frodo sets out on the Ring-quest. The film seems to condense the first interval to exactly as long as it takes Gandalf to make the trip to Minas Tirith and back, a few weeks or months, and Frodo sets out the next day.",,,,,,,,
Adapted Out," Tom Bombadil and his wife Goldberry, together with the Hobbits' entire ""Old Forest"" adventure. Glorfindel's role of rescuing Frodo from the Nazgûl and bringing him to Rivendell is given to Arwen. The Scouring of the Shire is absent from the films' canon, instead shown as a Bad Future .",,,,,,,,
Bad Future," of the Shire is absent from the films' canon, instead shown as a Bad Future .",,,,,,,,
Admitting to Fear," When Frodo is confronted by Stryder at The Prancing Pony, Stryder asks him if he's frightened. Frodo gives a sincere, ""Yes."" Stryder/Aragorn: Not nearly frightened enough. I know what hunts you.",,,,,,,,
Affectionate Gesture to the Head," Boromir pats Frodo during their attempted trek over Caradhras. After picking up the Ring, he gives it back to Frodo only after an order from Aragorn. He ruffles Frodo's hair to lighten the mood, but the Fellowship stays wary.",,,,,,,,
Age Cut," Averted when Elrond talks to Gandalf about an incident thousands of years in the past. We cut to a shot of Elrond in the past and he looks exactly the same, since elves are immortal .",,,,,,,,
Agony of the Feet," Averted when the other hobbits make a fire on Weathertop (inadvertently drawing the Nazgûl to them) and Frodo panics when he sees it and tries to put it out with his foot . Hobbits are stated to have tough soles in the book — basically their feet are their shoes, and they have a lot more fur on them than depicted in the film (the Rankin/Bass Productions animated adaptations do a much better job of what their feet are supposed to look like).",,,,,,,,
All There in the Script," In the theatrical cut of the movie, Galadriel's name only appears once, in an unclear context if you don't know it's her name (""I will diminish, and go into the west, and remain Galadriel""). The extended edition has Haldir introducing both Galadriel and Celeborn, and in The Hobbit Gandalf makes sure to namedrop her.",,,,,,,,
Always a Bigger Fish, The goblins have the party surrounded in the mines of Moria — until the Balrog makes its first appearance. They run for it. So does everyone else.,,,,,,,,
Animal Espionage," Saruman has crows that serve as spies, and one scene has The Fellowship take cover when a flock of crows fly overhead before we see them report in back at Isengard.",,,,,,,,
Annoying Arrows," Boromir manages to continue fighting even while pincushioned by arrows as thick as sausages. However, the scene is presented as his Last Stand ; he clearly knows he is dead after the first arrow, and is using Heroic Resolve to take as many orcs down with him as he can. Later, Pippin states, ""The mightiest man may be slain by one arrow, and Boromir was pierced by many.""",,,,,,,,
Armor Is Useless," Merry and Pippin take several heavily armored Uruk-hai down by throwing rocks at their heavily armored heads, and whether or not they're outright killed is never clarified.",,,,,,,,
Armor-Piercing Question," When Frodo is angrily musing that it's a pity Bilbo didn't kill Gollum when he had the chance, Gandalf points out that it was pity that stayed Bilbo's hand: ""Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them, Frodo?""",,,,,,,,
Arrow Cam," Features another ""point of view"" arrow shot.",,,,,,,,
Art Imitates Art, The designs for the Mines of Moria sets were inspired by the works of Venetian artist Giovanni Battista Piranesi and M.C. Escher .,,,,,,,,
Ash Face," Merry and Pippin, after setting off a firework at Bilbo's birthday party.",,,,,,,,
Attack! Attack... Retreat! Retreat!," A rare case of this trope Played for Drama , and definitely not a Tactical Withdrawal , happens after discovering the long-dead dwarves inside the West Gate of the mines of Moria. Boromir: We should never have come here. Now get out of here; get out! [cue attack by Watcher in the Water] Gandalf: Into the mines!",,,,,,,,
Attack the Mouth, Legolas kills the cave troll by shooting an arrow through its mouth into its brain.,,,,,,,,
Audience Murmurs," Played for Laughs when Bilbo is giving his farewell and says, ""I don't know half of you half as well as I should like and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve."" This is straight out of the book where it describes the response as scattered applause with most of the audience working it out to see if it came out to a compliment. The movie conveys this reaction with mostly blank looks in the audience.",,,,,,,,
Award-Bait Song," The films have two sad examples: ""May It Be"" and ""In Dreams"". ""May it Be"" was nominated for an Oscar.",,,,,,,,
Badass Boast," ""I am a servant of the Secret Fire , wielder of the flame of Anor. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn! Go back to the shadow... YOU SHALL NOT PASS!""",,,,,,,,
Bad Future," The Scouring of the Shire from the books is turned into this in the film. Frodo is invited to look into the Mirror of Galadriel. He is shown a vision of the Shire being destroyed, orcs slaughtering other hobbits, the four (Merry, Pippin, Frodo and Sam) chained and forced to walk , being whipped by orcs. Galadriel tells Frodo that this is what will happen should he fail in his quest to destroy the Ring.",,,,,,,,
Bait-and-Switch," Played for drama: the film shows Saurons tower looking over Mordor below near the start of the first act; the tower depicted, however, is only a guard tower. The camera then pans across to show the actual tower of Barad-dur; and it's much, much bigger.",,,,,,,,
Beauty Is Never Tarnished," Frodo is badly stabbed on Weathertop, Boromir catches several arrows in his chest.",,,,,,,,
Behind a Stick," In the scene where the hobbits are hiding from a Black Rider, the Rider actually emerges from behind a tree instead of riding in from the right side of the screen as you would expect, despite said tree being too small to hide the Rider and his horse.",,,,,,,,
Behind the Black," Gimli claims he has ""eyes like a hawk"" but doesn't notice the squadron of elves with their arrows pointed at him.",,,,,,,,
Being Watched, Celeborn warns the Fellowship that they're being hunted by Orcs before leaving Lothlorien.,,,,,,,,
Big Badass Battle Sequence," The battle between the Last Alliance and Mordor in the prologue certainly counts. The Battle at Amon Hen is much smaller in scale, pitting the Fellowship against a small army of Uruk-hai, but it's still an extremely impressive action sequence.",,,,,,,,
Big Damn Heroes," During the Battle at Amon Hen, Merry and Pippin have lured the Uruk-hai away from Frodo but are surrounded on all sides when Boromir leaps in and intercepts the closest Mook with his bare hands.",,,,,,,,
"Big ""NO!"""," The film has two: Gimli has one when he discovers the tomb of Balin, which dissolves into mournful blubbering. Frodo also has one when Gandalf appears to die.",,,,,,,,
Black Knight," Sauron from the intro of the opening wears a huge suit of armour, roars monstrously, and swings a gigantic mace everywhere, sending scores of soldiers flying with each blow. He is modelled after his former master Morgoth from The Silmarillion , and the books ( or at least the appendix ) did mention him taking part in this particular battle personally, so at least it's fairly justified.",,,,,,,,
Black Speech," Gandalf uses it to dramatic effect in Imladris/Rivendell, complete with Empathic Environment . It also appears to cause elves such as Elrond and Legolas physical pain, as both wince at its usage.",,,,,,,,
Blade Lock," Aragorn's final confrontation with the Uruk-hai chief Lurtz begins with the two pushing their swords against each other for about two seconds, before Lurtz demonstrates his overwhelming strength by shoving Aragorn backwards into a tree.",,,,,,,,
Blatant Lies," Gandalf offers up a couple of them early on: Gandalf: A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins, nor is he early, he arrives precisely when he means to. Gandalf: If you're referring to the incident with the Dragon, I was barely involved. All I did was give your uncle a little nudge out of the door.",,,,,,,,
Blood from the Mouth," When Aragorn is fighting Lurtz, the orc headbutts him in the face and his mouth is bleeding afterward.",,,,,,,,
Blowing Smoke Rings," Gandalf and Bilbo share some pipeweed. Bilbo blows a smoke ring, then Gandalf uses his magic to create a full-masted tall ship out of smoke, which he then ""sails"" through Bilbo's smoke ring.",,,,,,,,
"Boom, Headshot!"," Legolas shoots an Orc in the head while crossing the stairs in Khazad-Dum, with enough force that the arrow sticks in the pillar behind the Orc.",,,,,,,,
Bow and Sword in Accord," Aragorn uses both bow and sword, but he usually uses the bow only to open battle, staying in melee once it opens. The Uruk-hai captain (Lurtz) at the end also employs a bow/sword combo.",,,,,,,,
Bows and Errors," During the Moria sequence, a CGI shot of one of Legolas' arrows shows the arrowhead moving along a perfect arc to the target, while the shaft and fletching dangle and shake behind it at random.",,,,,,,,
Break His Heart to Save Him," Frodo tries to set off on his own, knowing his quest to Mordor will probably kill him and hoping the others will find a safer way to help save the world. Even when Sam catches up to him, Frodo first refuses to look at him and then explicitly commands him to return to shore. Sam ignores him, and Frodo ends up having to save him from drowning. Afterwards, he gratefully accepts that there's no way he's getting rid of him.",,,,,,,,
Breaking the Fellowship," The Trope Namer. Not all members of the fellowship meet together again, since one of them dies and one is irrevocably transformed in the interim. They manage eight of the original nine. Legolas: Hurry! Frodo and Sam have reached the eastern shore. [Aragorn stands still and says nothing.] Legolas: You mean not to follow them? Aragorn: Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands. Gimli: Then it has all been in vain! The Fellowship has failed. Aragorn: Not if we hold true to each other. We will not abandon Merry and Pippin to torment and death. Not while we have strength left.",,,,,,,,
Bring It," Witch-King: Give up the Halfling, she-elf. Arwen: [draws sword] If you want him... come and claim him!",,,,,,,,
Brutal Brawl," Gandalf discovers Saruman has joined forces with Sauron and a Wizard Duel erupts between the two of them. It's shown as a telekinetic staff fight, and without one laying a finger on the other the two wizards slam each other into stone walls and doors. The brutality is actually enhanced by the actors being elderly men. Aragorn's fight with the Uruk-Hai, Lurtz; a brief, nasty scuffle that features Aragorn getting his nose broken by a headbutt, Lurtz stabbed with a dagger, and finally Aragorn lopping off his arm and head.",,,,,,,,
Wizard Duel,"vers Saruman has joined forces with Sauron and a Wizard Duel erupts between the two of them. It's shown as a telekinetic staff fight, and without one laying a finger on the other the two wizards slam each other into stone walls and doors. The brutality is actually enhanced by the actors being elderly men.",,,,,,,,
Buffy Speak," Pippin during the creation of the Fellowship: ""You need people of intelligence in this kind of mission... quest... thing.""",,,,,,,,
Bugs Herald Evil," Insects and spiders come out of the woodwork in droves when the hobbits arrive to seek the ring, fleeing from the Nazgûl.",,,,,,,,
Bulletproof Vest," In the Mines of Moria, Frodo appears to be fatally stabbed by a cave troll, but soon after reveals that he's wearing an impenetrable shirt of mithril beneath his coat. This also happens in the book, though he is stabbed by an orc and suffers a greater injury from the impact: the mithril coat prevents him from being stabbed, sure, but the sheer force from the spear thrust still knocks him out, drives the rings of the mail coat into his body and badly bruises him. Frodo needed medical attention from Aragorn soon afterward or he would not have been able to keep up with the company in their journey.",,,,,,,,
Butterfly of Transformation, The white moth that brings giant eagles to the rescue when Gandalf is imprisoned at Orthanc.,,,,,,,,
Canon Foreigner," Lurtz, the Uruk-Hai leader, does not appear in the books; Boromir is killed by an anonymous Orc and his death goes unwitnessed, and Aragorn does not fight any of them. Lurtz was invented for the film to give the Uruk-Hai a face. His name is never spoken aloud in the theatrical release, and only appears in the end credits. However, in the Extended Edition, Lurtz's name is spoken by Saruman. Despite some initial fears that he was an entirely new character, he really wasn't much different from other ""generic Uruk-hai leaders"" already present in the book.",,,,,,,,
Carry a Big Stick, The movie has Big Bad Sauron wielding a mace big enough to knock half-a-dozen men into the air with every sweep.,,,,,,,,
Catch a Falling Star," Gandalf's escape from Isengard via Gwaihir Air Service. Also counts as a Suicidal ""Gotcha!"" .",,,,,,,,
Chase Stops at Water," The first Nazgûl the Hobbits meet pursues them to the Bucklebury Ferry, but quickly reins in his horse when Frodo jumps onto the barge. This is a hint at their supernatural nature; as undead, they hate crossing rivers . Later, Frodo (carried on a horse by Arwen) is again violently chased by Nazgûls, but because Arwen is able to reach the Bruinen River, the Nazgûls cannot pursue them further; Arwen then also magically summons the Bruinen River to literally wash the Nazgûls away.",,,,,,,,
crossing rivers,"the Hobbits meet pursues them to the Bucklebury Ferry, but quickly reins in his horse when Frodo jumps onto the barge. This is a hint at their supernatural nature; as undead, they hate crossing rivers .",,,,,,,,
Cliff Stack," A four-hobbit version occurs when they're fleeing from the Ringwraith and comes at the edge of a cliff. Of course, it's Sam who's the last stacker, and unwittingly pushes all the others down. Bonus points for Pippin nearly landing in some dung and Merry breaking his, er, carrot.",,,,,,,,
Combat Breakdown," After nearly three hours of epic High Fantasy swordplay, the final duel between Aragorn and the Uruk-Hai captain Lurtz devolves into a comparatively fast but extremely vicious physical brawl between the two of them stabbing, choking, punching, headbutting, and generally beating the absolute hell out of one another. It only ends when Aragorn cuts off his arm, stabs him in the chest up to Anduril's hilt, and finally cuts off the Orc's head.",,,,,,,,
Combat Tentacles," The Watcher in the Water, which wasn't clearly described in the book , is shown as a giant squid-like monster when it attacks the Company.",,,,,,,,
Come with Me If You Want to Live," Aragorn gets introduced this way in Bree, as a wilderness expert who can outrun the Nazgûl. More so in the film, since they set out that very morning after they outwit the Nazgûl ambush. In the film, Aragorn fits the trope to a T: Frodo: Where are you taking us? Aragorn: Into the wild . Merry: How do we know this Strider is a friend of Gandalf? Frodo: We have no choice but to trust him.",,,,,,,,
Comically Missing the Point," While on Weathertop, being chased by the Nazgûl, Frodo goes to sleep, only to wake up to the other hobbits cooking food. Frodo: What are you doing?! [meaning, Why are you lighting a fire when we have demonic ghosts chasing us?!] Merry: Tomatoes, sausages, and nice, crispy bacon.",,,,,,,,
Confusing Multiple Negatives," A botched translation of the movie has Saruman claim ""He can't not yet take physical form"" when referring to Sauron . The creator of the website showing the botched translation baffled over what the double negative meant before promptly giving up.",,,,,,,,
Consummate Storyteller," Bilbo is prone to regaling Hobbiton with tales of his adventures, such that at his 111th birthday party, we see a group of hobbit children gathered at his feet, listening with rapt attention to him recounting the tale of how three trolls had caught him and his dwarf companions, and were debating the best way to cook and eat them all.",,,,,,,,
Continuity Nod," In Elrond's council, there's the symbol of an eight-pointed star on the ground in front of his seat. In The Silmarillion , Elrond was reared by two Fëanorians, whose symbol was an eight-pointed star.",,,,,,,,
Convenient Escape Boat," This is done somewhat when the Nazgûl are chasing the hobbits — and the hobbits pull off in the ferry, before Frodo even gets there. Naturally, Frodo has to jump for it — and makes it... just in time. (In the book, it was nowhere this dramatic; the Nazgûl follows them to the river, but is unseen until long after they've pulled off.)",,,,,,,,
Conveniently Timed Attack from Behind," Lurtz (the Uruk-Hai captain) is about to finish off Boromir when Aragorn appears to fight him off. It's too late for Boromir, though.",,,,,,,,
Courtly Love," Gimli, almost immediately after seeing Galadriel. When she is bestowing gifts on the fellowship prior to their departure, all he requests is a strand of her golden hair . She gives him three .",,,,,,,,
Creative Closing Credits, They contain the names of every single member of the Tolkien fan club in the special edition.,,,,,,,,
Creator Cameo," The prologue has cameos by: Senior prosthetics supervisor Gino Acevedo and prosthetics technicians Rich Mayberry and Xander Forterie as three of the seven Dwarf Lords who receive Rings of Power; Concept artists John Howe and Alan Lee play two of the Nine Kings; and Weta production worker Ben Britton and pre-viz storyboard shader Jason Secto play elves fighting in the Last Alliance. Peter Jackson in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it appearance as ""Albert Dreary"" (a man eating a carrot) when the hobbits arrive in Bree. The hellish screeching noises made by the Ringwraiths were delivered by Fran Walsh, co-writer, producer, and Peter Jackson's partner.",,,,,,,,
John Howe,e has cameos by: Senior prosthetics supervisor Gino Acevedo and prosthetics technicians Rich Mayberry and Xander Forterie as three of the seven Dwarf Lords who receive Rings of Power; Concept artists John Howe and Alan Lee play two of the Nine Kings; and Weta production worker Ben Britton and pre-viz storyboard shader Jason Secto play elves fighting in the Last Alliance.,,,,,,,,
John Howe,ists John Howe and Alan Lee play two of the Nine Kings; and,,,,,,,,
Creepy Centipedes, A centipede and some spiders appear for added creepiness when the hobbits are hiding from the first Black Rider. Although they're less creepy in themselves as it's more like the bugs are trying to get away from the Ringwraith.,,,,,,,,
Creepy Crows," Like in the book, ravens and crows are generally an ill omen. The ""crebain from Dunland"" that Legolas sees near the Misty Mountains are servants of Saruman, reporting on the position of the Fellowship for him. Gandalf: The Enemy has many spies... beasts, and birds...",,,,,,,,
Crucified Hero Shot, Gandalf adopts this pose when pulled off the bridge by the falling Balrog.,,,,,,,,
Cruel to Be Kind," After their narrow escape from the Mines of Moria, most of the Fellowship is extremely distraught at the loss of Gandalf and stop just outside the exit to mourn. However, Aragorn orders Boromir to get them on their feet and continue the journey, answering protests of not giving them a moment by noting that by nightfall, the whole area will be crawling with Orcs fully intent on killing them or worse, and the Fellowship must get to safety before dusk.",,,,,,,,
Cut Apart," The movie has closeups of sleeping hobbits mixed with Ringwraiths surrounding the beds. When the stabbing begins, we discover the beds are empty and the hobbits in another room.",,,,,,,,
Deadly Nosebleed, Gandalf sports one of these during his battle against the Balrog.,,,,,,,,
Death Is Such an Odd Thing," Orlando Bloom said in the commentaries for the extended edition that this is what he was trying for, when the camera had its closeup on his face in the One-Woman Wail montage after Gandalf fell: he was coming to grips with what death was, as an elf whose only experience with it previously had been seeing enemies die in battle.",,,,,,,,
Death of a Thousand Cuts, How the Fellowship kills the cave troll in Moria .,,,,,,,,
Deathly Dies Irae," ""Dies irae"" appears in the score as Bilbo's ring tempts him one last time before he leaves the Shire. It weighs heavily on him as he slowly tips his hand to let it fall to the floor, right after it has been made clear that there is something dangerous about it and it is likely the One Ring. Heard again as the Ringwraiths corner the hobbits at Weathertop. Also reoccurs as part of the motif for the forces of Isengard.",,,,,,,,
Defeat Equals Explosion," Sauron explodes with the force of a tactical nuke after Isildur cuts the ring from his hand in the prologue of the movie, flooring basically everyone across the battlefield with the shockwave.",,,,,,,,
Deliberate Injury Gambit," In a villainous version, the Uruk-Hai leader is impaled on Aragorn's sword, and pulls himself up the blade to get up in his face and snarl. Aragorn promptly yanks the sword back out and lops off his head.",,,,,,,,
Delicious Distraction," During the extended version opening of the movie (well, second opening; during the Concerning Hobbits scene), a hobbit-maid is about to kiss her hobbit-lover, who is distracted by a basket of muffins going around and eats it instead. At the exact same moment, Bilbo narrates that ""a Hobbit's only true love is for food.""",,,,,,,,
Depth of Field," A faked long depth-of-field is accomplished by putting a prop ring the size of a plate in the foreground. That way, the One Ring lying in the snow appears in as much sharpness as the stuff in the background.",,,,,,,,
Digital Head Swap, One of the techniques used to create the proper scale for the Hobbits.,,,,,,,,
Disapproving Look," There's a two-fer early in the film as Gandalf is riding into the Shire with Frodo, who is explaining how Gandalf has come to be labeled a ""disturber of the peace"" while an old Hobbit sees them and gives Gandalf a very disapproving look. Then the children of the Shire see him and come running, Gandalf setting off some fireworks to delight them. The old Hobbit watches them cheering with a boisterous laugh, then stops as his wife comes out and give him her own disapproving look.",,,,,,,,
Distant Prologue," The movie starts with Galadriel narrating several crucial events leading up to the series. These include the creation of the Rings of Power (c. 4900 years ago), the War of the Last Alliance (c. 3000 years ago), and Bilbo Baggins taking the One Ring from Gollum (60 years ago). It then cuts to Bilbo's 111th birthday party and his departure for Rivendell, leaving Frodo and the One Ring behind, which happened a decade before the film proper begins.",,,,,,,,
Doing Research," After Bilbo leaves the Shire, Gandalf already has suspicions about the magical ring transmitted to Frodo. The Wizard is next seen doing historical research to learn more about the One Ring, notably the story of Isildur, to confirm those suspicions.",,,,,,,,
"Don't Ask, Just Run"," Gandalf says this when the Fellowship encounters the Balrog in Moria, sparked by ominous roaring and a creeping orange glow that makes the horde of goblins surrounding them run like hell. Gandalf's only explanation is ""This foe is beyond any of you. RUN!"" And, of course, just before he falls into the chasm: ""Fly, you fools!""",,,,,,,,
"Don't Touch It, You Idiot!"," While the gang is deep in the mines of Moria, Pippin the Hobbit innocently fiddles with an ancient suit of armour... Gandalf reacts appropriately.",,,,,,,,
Downer Ending," The Fellowship breaks in the end. Gandalf falls to his apparent doom, Boromir is killed, and Frodo and Sam have to journey into Mordor alone while Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas have to save Merry and Pippin from Saruman's Uruk-Hai.",,,,,,,,
Dramatic Necklace Removal," Isildur does this in order to get the One Ring off the chain around his neck and onto his finger when he was ambushed near the start of the movie. It's justified since he was under attack and therefore in a bit of a hurry, though there are the numerous other times somebody yanked the One Ring free of its chain.",,,,,,,,
Draw Aggro," Merry and Pippin call out to the Uruk Hai to distract them from Frodo's hiding place. Pippin: It's working! Merry: I know it's working, RUN!",,,,,,,,
Dug Too Deep," According to Saruman, the Dwarves of Moria did this, unleashing the Balrog .",,,,,,,,
The Dulcinea Effect, Gimli goes from describing Galadriel as a wicked sorceress to pledging himself as her Knight In Shining Armour within days of meeting her.,,,,,,,,
Dungeon Bypass," Averted; the Fellowship tries to go around Moria via a mountain pass, but Saruman awakens the mountain of Caradhras, causing an avalanche of rocks and snow that blocks their way, causing our heroes to have to backtrack and go through Moria anyway.",,,,,,,,
Ear Ache," After Merry and Pippin set off one of Gandalf's fireworks without his permission, he lifts them up by the pointy tips of their ears and glares down at them like they are misbehaving children.",,,,,,,,
Early-Bird Cameo," Inverted. Rohan appears briefly in the first book, establishing that the nation will enter the plot in the second. Played straight with Minas Tirith, Osgiliath and Minas Morgul. All three cities make brief appearances in this film during the ""Account of Isildur"" sequence (literally a split second in Osgiliath's case during the establishing shot of the Gondor-Mordor border) before becoming much more important in The Two Towers (albeit for Osgiliath, especially in the Extended Edition) and The Return of the King . Musical example with the Gondor Leitmotif in the case of the Extended Edition. The theme makes a brief early appearance during the Council of Elrond sequence (when Bormoir speaks of how Gondor and Denethor’s sacrifices have kept the West safe). It'll go on to reappear briefly in the Extended Editon of The Tower Towers (during the flashback to Bormoir and Faramir retaking Osgiliath) before finally taking center stage during The Return of the King .",,,,,,,,
Leitmotif,mple with the Gondor Leitmotif in the case of the Extended Edition. The theme makes a brief early appearance during the Council of Elrond sequence (when Bormoir speaks of how Gondor and Denethor’s sacrifices have kept the West safe). It'll go on to reappear briefly in the Extended Editon of The Tower Towers (during the flashback to Bormoir and Faramir retaking Osgiliath) before finally taking center stage during The Return of the King .,,,,,,,,
Early Installment Character-Design Difference, Downplayed. The designs of Gollum and the Eye of Sauron aren't quite as polished as in the next two films.,,,,,,,,
Establishing Character Moment," Quite a few. Sam telling Frodo the promise he made to Gandalf in the beginning. (""Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee!"") Merry and Pippin's mischief at Bilbo's birthday party. Boromir instantly suggesting the Ring be turned over to Gondor to use against Sauron. Legolas defending Aragorn against Boromir. Gimli grabbing an axe and attempting to destroy the Ring right at the council. Saruman chastising Gandalf for consorting with Hobbits. Lurtz chokes the first orc he sees within seconds of his birth. Gandalf arriving in Hobbiton for Bilbo's birthday party. All the children are excited to see him , while the adults look on disapprovingly (for the most part, one Hobbit laughs at a miniature fireworks display only to frown when his wife appears.) The first glimpse of the Lady Galadriel (other than the flash of her eyes that Frodo sees when he hears her voice in his mind) is her descending the stairs in Caras Galadhon with Celeborn in a blinding, majestic aura of white light. 'The Lady of Light', indeed!",,,,,,,,
All the children are excited to see him,"birthday party. All the children are excited to see him , while the adults look on disapprovingly (for the most part, one Hobbit laughs at a miniature fireworks display only to frown when his wife appears.)",,,,,,,,
Everybody Cries, The entire Fellowship cries after losing Gandalf.,,,,,,,,
Evil Sounds Deep," The Uruk-Hai captain Lurtz has a very deep voice, as do other orcs, when they're not given shrill, raspy voices.",,,,,,,,
Evil Tower of Ominousness," The (original) Dark Tower, Barad-dûr. It's actually depicted as under construction; the completed tower itself is first seen at the end of the film, from the Seat of Amon Hen.",,,,,,,,
Extreme Close-Up, Galadriel's intro scene frequently cuts right up to Galadriel's eyes and then cuts back to the eyes of a member of the Fellowship. This is a visual adaptation of the narration from the book which makes clear everyone in the Fellowship felt Galadriel's eyes piercing into their soul.,,,,,,,,
Fade to White," Used when Frodo first sees Arwen and later Elrond, when he's dying from the Morgul blade.",,,,,,,,
Fake Shemp," When Bilbo finds the Ring at the start of the movie, Gollum cries out, ""My precious!"". However, Andy Serkis was not on set that day, so Dominic Monaghan stood in for him.",,,,,,,,
Fanfare, The fellowship theme.,,,,,,,,
Fatal Fireworks," There's a comedic, non-fatal example: at Bilbo's birthday party, Pippin and Merry steal and launch one of Gandalf's firework rockets, ending up with an Ash Face .",,,,,,,,
Fear Is the Appropriate Response," Gandalf doesn't just inform the other characters that the Balrog is unstoppable. He calmly explains what a Balrog actually is while it's coming at them (it wasn't even in visual range), pauses to take a deep breath, looks shaken, and then shouts... ""RUN!"" and takes off ahead of the others, while they are still standing there looking at it. Making an about-face in the process.",,,,,,,,
Final Battle," The attack in Amon Hen, where Saruman's Uruk-Hai ambush the Fellowship of the Ring. Aragorn manages to behead the Uruk leader Lutz, Boromir dies, Frodo and Sam flee separately and Merry and Pippin are taken away by the Uruks, which breaks the Fellowship .",,,,,,,,
Final Speech," While Boromir had some last dying words in the book, they really spice it up in the film, especially with Boromir's last line to Aragorn: ""My brother, my captain, my king"".",,,,,,,,
Finger Extinguisher, Aragorn puts out a flame with his bare hand at the Prancing Pony when taking Frodo away for a private discussion.,,,,,,,,
Fire-Forged Friends," Gimli and Legolas probably count as Trope Codifiers. They openly hate each other at their first meeting (Gimli: ""Never trust an elf!""), but by the end of the final film, they are inseparable. (Excerpt from The Return of the King ) Gimli: Never thought I'd die fighting side by side with an Elf. Legolas: What about side by side with a friend? Gimli: ...aye. I could do that.",,,,,,,,
Flaming Sword," The Balrog has one of these, along with a fiery whip .",,,,,,,,
Foe-Tossing Charge," Sauron during the prologue, to get to Isildur. He enters the battlefield and starts smacking a half dozen soldiers forty feet into the air with each swing of his mace.",,,,,,,,
Forced Perspective," Used to great effect to help the average-height actors playing hobbits and dwarves seem to-scale with their man and elf co-stars. Used in reverse in one shot: While climbing Caradhras, Frodo falls and drops the Ring. There is a shot of the Ring lying in the snow in the foreground. The filmmakers used a larger model of the Ring, 6 inches in diameter, in this shot to make it seem closer while still being in-focus.",,,,,,,,
Foreshadowing," In an Extended-Version-only scene, Frodo and Sam see a group of Wood-Elves on their way to the Grey Havens while they're leaving the Shire. The final film ends with Frodo going to the Grey Havens and leaving Middle-earth with the rest of the elves . As Gandalf tries to lead the Fellowship through the Pass of Caradhras, Boromir picks up the One Ring after Frodo stumbles down hill and ""drops"" it. Boromir returns it after some hesitation and obsessing over it. Later, Boromir tries to take the Ring forcefully, having gotten a taste of its influence before. Boromir narrowly avoids being hit by arrows in Moria. On a related note, Isildur is killed by three arrows - the same amount as Boromir. Aragorn realizes that they're being followed by Gollum, but says that he's ""too good a waterman"" to catch. In The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King we see a flashback of Smeagol and Deagol pole-fishing from a boat, and Deagol proves to be a good swimmer. This bit in the Extended Edition also explicitly establishes that Gollum made out of Moria and is still on the Fellowship’s tail. This sets up Gollum continuing to follow Frodo and Sam once they split off from the Fellowship and finally making his move at the beginning of the next film (something was only implied in the Theatrical Edition).",,,,,,,,

Forging Scene," The forging of the One Ring by Sauron is shown during the film's prologue. There's also the mass-production of the Uruk-hai's ugly but effective weapons and armor emphasizes the Industrialized Evil of Isengard. The reforging of Narsil into Andúril is much more dramatic, and features Arwen reciting parts of the poem that serves as Aragorn's Trust Password in the books.",,,,,,,,

Forgot to Mind Their Head," This was a hazard both in and out of universe: During the scene where Gandalf visits Bilbo in his hobbit hole, Gandalf, stooping, accidentally backs into a chandelier (as part of the script). His actor Ian McKellen then promptly turns and accidentally smacks his head on the roof, an (unscripted) accident so funny that they left it in . invoked In the gag reel, this happens also to the crew. Everyone's sitting inside the hobbit hole listening to directions, then when the meeting ends they all stand up and hit their heads on the roof. Then everyone falls to the floor.",,,,,,,,

Freeze-Frame Bonus," Peter Jackson points out on the DVD Commentary that if you’re paying attention during the wide shots for Bilbo’s birthday party speech, you’ll realize that his birthday cake is melting. This was due to the polystyrene catching fire from the 111 candles (hence the smoke and glow on Ian Holm’s face). But because Holm was on a roll, they kept shooting and cropped out the cake in post-production.",,,,,,,,
Friends All Along," Aragorn is hurrying to find a herb to heal Frodo when someone sneaks up behind him and holds a blade to his throat. Said person turns out to be Arwen, teasing him.",,,,,,,,
Frying Pan of Doom, Sam uses his cooking gear to whack some goblins in Moria. Sam: I think I'm getting the hang of this.,,,,,,,,
Full-Contact Magic, Gandalf and Saruman's staff-fight in Saruman's chambers involves them striking the air with their staves and generating telekinetic waves against the opponent.,,,,,,,,
Ghostly Glide, The Nazgûl move like ghosts when they invade the Prancing Pony.,,,,,,,,
Giant Squid," The Watcher in the Water is decidedly squid-like, with bits of octopus thrown in for good measure. In the books the description is a bit more vague but still retains most of the Giant Squid properties.",,,,,,,,
Giant Wall of Watery Doom," When Arwen conjures up the Bruinen river against the Black Riders (invoking a Mass ""Oh, Crap!"" out of them, but they can't outrun it). For added awesomeness, the waves are horse-shaped.",,,,,,,,
Gloved Fist of Doom, Boromir does this at least once while contemplating the power of the One Ring.,,,,,,,,
God Save Us from the Queen!," ""In place of a Dark Lord you would have a QUEEN! Not dark but beautiful and terrible as the dawn! Treacherous as the sea ! Stronger than the foundations of the Earth! All shall love me, and despair !""",,,,,,,,
Go Through Me," During the scene on Weathertop, the Ringwraiths casually fling aside the other hobbits trying to protect Frodo.",,,,,,,,
Great Offscreen War," The movie begins with Galadriel recounting the story of the last war with Sauron, several thousand years prior. We only see the end of the final battle.",,,,,,,,
Grief Song, Elves sing a tearjerking lament for Gandalf.,,,,,,,,
Hammer Hilt," When Aragorn faces down the entire horde of Uruk-Hai, he starts off the fight by following his first sword swing by smashing the crossguard of his sword into one Uruk's face.",,,,,,,,
Ham-to-Ham Combat," There's the massive ham-off between those two old thesps, Christopher Lee and Ian McKellen as Saruman and Gandalf. ""You have chosen the way of pain!"" indeed. No piece of the scenery is left unchewed.",,,,,,,,
Happily Ever Before," The book ends with Boromir trying to steal the Ring, the departure of Frodo and Sam for Mordor and the capture of Merry and Pippin by the Uruk-hai. The film inverts it by including the first chapter of The Two Towers , which has the redemption and death of Boromir and the Three Hunters giving chase to the hobbits' captors, arguably ending on a more positive, hopeful note that comes afterwards .",,,,,,,,
Heroic Second Wind," Subverted. Boromir takes an arrow, goes down... gets back up and keeps fighting. Four times before he can no longer get up again, taking out at least two orcs each time.",,,,,,,,
Hoist by His Own Petard, The axe-wielding Uruk-hai takes his own axe in his back from Boromir.,,,,,,,,
Hollywood Drowning, Averted. Sam's near-drowning occurs without much flailing or noise. Frodo knows he's drowning because he knows Sam can't swim.,,,,,,,,
Homage Shot," Peter Jackson shot one bit at Bilbo's birthday party (""Proudfeet!"") as an exact copy of a shot in Ralph Bakshi 's animated Lord of the Rings . Jackson even helpfully points this out in the commentary. A circle-round shot of the four hobbits at Weathertop is also lifted from the original, although the camera moves much faster and Aragorn is absent. Same goes for the four hobbits hiding under a root by the wayside with the Nazgûl leaning in above them. Not exactly an homage shot, but the Nazgûl attacking the Hobbits' room at the Prancing Pony was drawn from Bakshi's film. In the books, it's explicitly stated by Aragorn that they would not have openly attacked the inn in this manner, and that their assailants were instead Men of Bree under their influence.",,,,,,,,

Hope Spot," The film begins with one. During the battle between the Last Alliance of Elves and Man against Sauron's forces, the Alliance nearly succeeds in driving back the forces of Mordor... only for Sauron himself to join the battle and singlehandedly turn the tide back in his favor. But ironically, this also counts as a Hope Spot for Sauron too. Right as he's crushing the Alliance and on the cusp of total victory, Isildur severs the ring from his hand, separating him from his source of power and destroying his physical body. Gandalf gets one In-Universe when he uses the information he obtained in Minas Tirith to test the One Ring. The Ring doesn't react to fire and for a moment, Gandalf's quietly relieved he was wrong and this isn't the evil artifact he'd feared it was... and then Frodo spots the emerging Black Speech... Probably the cruelest one in film history is when Gandalf sends the Balrog off the bridge and begins turning back... only for the tips of its whip to catch Gandalf by the foot and leave him dangling off the side of the bridge.",,,,,,,,

Horns of Villainy," The Balrog wasn't clearly described in the novels, but it's given large ram-like horns, giving it a beast-like appearance.",,,,,,,,
Horrifying the Horror," An army of goblins surround the Fellowship, only to immediately scurry off in fear after hearing the roar of the Balrog.",,,,,,,,
Hostile Weather," The snowstorm on Caradhras. The movie clearly shows that Saruman is behind it too, while in the book it's left vague.",,,,,,,,
How Much Did You Hear?," Gandalf catches Sam outside the Baggins home, demands to know how much Sam heard and then has Sam accompany Frodo on his journey. Gandalf: What did you hear?! Speak! Sam: N-nothing important! That is, I heard a good deal about a ring and a Dark Lord, and something about the end of the world...",,,,,,,,
Human Traffic Jam, Happens when the Hobbits are running away from Farmer Maggot; doubles as a Cliff Stack .,,,,,,,,
I Fight for the Strongest Side!," One of Saruman 's reasonings for betraying the Free Peoples and siding with Sauron is that at his core, he's always believed that the battle between good and evil can only be won through a matter of power (as noted by Gandalf in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey ) — and he's seen and learned enough about Sauron's power to believe that he can't be stopped and the only options available are to either join him or die.",,,,,,,,
Implausible Deniability," When Gandalf catches Sam eavesdropping at Bag End, the latter insists he was just simply cutting the grass, that’s all. That explanation might have worked…if it wasn’t currently the middle of the night. Gandalf naturally lampshades this.",,,,,,,,
Improbable Aiming Skills," In addition to Legolas, who, as an elf, naturally demonstrates absurd skill, there's the opening battle of Mount Doom, where human archers shoot down orcs on the mountainside a good quarter mile away (long range for a modern infantry rifle, much less a bow). Perhaps justified if one accepts that it's Galadriel's recounting of events she didn't actually see but was simply told of.",,,,,,,,
Inevitable Waterfall," This scene appears to pop up, but it's okay, they're just banking at The Gates of Argonath . When Frodo and Samwise paddle across the lake, there doesn't even seem to be a current moving toward the falls!",,,,,,,,
Instantly Proven Wrong," As the fellowship is travelling through forbidden Elven woods, Gimli declares that he won't be caught easily, because he has ""the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox."" A split second later, he sees elves pointing drawn bows at him less than half a meter away, and Haldir claims that he was breathing so loudly that they could have shot him in the dark. Gimli: Here's one dwarf they won't ensnare so easily! I've got the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox. [cue elvish arrows drawn at Gimli's head at point-blank range]",,,,,,,,
Inverse Dialogue/Death Rule," Boromir takes forever to be killed (arrow after arrow, and overcranked as well), complete with a speech to Aragorn after the latter just had a big duel with the chief Uruk-Hai.",,,,,,,,
Ironic Echo," Gandalf finds a record of Isildur's journal, accounting the finding of the One Ring. Isildur: I will risk no harm to the Ring. It is precious to me. Averted in some dubs where they change Gollum's my precious but miss this echo .",,,,,,,,
miss this echo,dubs where they change Gollum's my precious but miss this echo .,,,,,,,,
It Has Been an Honour," Boromir's last words to Aragorn. Boromir: I would have followed you, my brother... my captain... my king .",,,,,,,,
It May Help You on Your Quest," Galadriel's gifts. All of them. Even moreso in the book, where she gives Sam a box of dirt with a mallorn nut in it. It helps.",,,,,,,,
It Was a Gift," Mostly skips over Galadriel's gift giving, only mentioning her gift to Frodo. But in a deleted scene Gimli talks about his gift — Galadriel wasn't sure what to give him, so he asked for a single strand of hair from her head, and she gave him three. Legolas's surprised smile, and Gimli's satisfied tone, make this a rather heartwarming scene — especially if the viewer is familiar with the origin of the Silmarils . Invoked when Aragorn — prior to setting out with the Fellowship — attempts to return the Evenstar pendant which Arwen had given him as a sign of her intention to choose a mortal life with him. She's hurt by the action and tells him, "" It was a gift. Keep it.""",,,,,,,,

I Want Them Alive!," When Saruman sends the Uruk-Hai out to battle, he tells the leader that ""one of the halflings [hobbits] carries something of great importance"" so he wants them alive ""and unspoiled"" (meaning, don't even search them for valuables). Luckily for Merry and Pippin, the Uruk leader doesn't know he has the wrong hobbits.",,,,,,,,
Jump Scare," Gandalf knows something's wrong with the Ring that he had to pressure Bilbo into finally discarding, but he isn't entirely sure just what it's capable of as he reaches for it. The instant his fingers grace its metal, a hellish eye of fire appears with a screaming sound and a boom more akin to primordial thunder not even a quarter of a second. It's no wonder the next scene cuts to him watching the nearby fireplace in a stupor to separate his mind from the horror he witnessed and not even realizing Frodo has entered for half a minute.",,,,,,,,
Keystone Army," In the Action Prologue , when Isildur desperately slices off the fingers of Sauron's ring-hand, all of Sauron's troops fall dead in an instant.",,,,,,,,
Kill It with Fire," Strider uses this method to drive off the Nazgûl at Weathertop, with a Throwing Your Torch Always Works finisher.",,,,,,,,
Kill the Lights," When Gandalf intimidates Bilbo to convince him to leave the Ring behind, the room darkens and his voice gains a menacing reverberation. He also seems to grow, though he may simply be standing up from a slouch. Gandalf: Bilbo Baggins, do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks! A similar effect happens during the Council of Elrond when Gandalf breaks up the squabble by reciting the ring couplet in Black Speech , though as this scene is outside, the darkening is less noticeable.",,,,,,,,
Black Speech,"ct happens during the Council of Elrond when Gandalf breaks up the squabble by reciting the ring couplet in Black Speech , though as this scene is outside, the darkening is less noticeable.",,,,,,,,
Killed Offscreen," The Hobbit who has a run-in with the Ringwraiths on the road. We see the lead wraith swing his sword, and the Hobbit's surprised face, but then it cuts back to Frodo and Gandalf talking in a Discretion Shot .",,,,,,,,
Kubrick Stare," Foreshadowed when Isildur (in flashback) gave Elrond exactly the same stare, in exactly the same circumstances. One of the powers of the One Ring is to cause Kubrick Stares.",,,,,,,,
Lancer vs. Dragon," Though Aragorn isn't the main hero and Lurtz isn't the main villain, their intense fight is the climax of the film.",,,,,,,,
Last Breath Bullet," Just when the Gandalf and the Fellowship believe that the Balrog is falling to its doom, it goes and pulls a Last Breath Whip and drags Gandalf along with it.",,,,,,,,
Last Day of Normalcy," Bilbo's birthday party introduces us to all the characters of Hobbiton prior to their being thrust into their adventure, from gentle and thoughtful Frodo to loyal and simple Samwise, to the mischievous pair of Merry and Pippin (their role changed somewhat from the books, where they were more savvy to Bilbo's magic ring). This is a downplayed example, though, as while it does serve the purpose of showing the tranquility of Hobbiton, it isn't until Gandalf returns with confirmation of the nature of Bilbo's ring that Frodo is thrust out the door on an adventure.",,,,,,,,
Last Kiss, Aragorn gave a dying Boromir a kiss on the forehead as part of a blessing.,,,,,,,,
Legend Fades to Myth," According to Galadriel's prologue, this is why things came to be as they were at the end of the Third Age: people forgot about past threats, and grew complacent. Sauron exploited that.",,,,,,,,
Let Us Never Speak of This Again," Subverted. After Gandalf says that Sauron must never find the Ring, Frodo says they'll put it away and never speak of it again... except that Sauron has already found Gollum, who also knew that Bilbo had the Ring, knows of the Shire, and has sent the Nazgûl to claim it.",,,,,,,,
Light Is Good, Arwen appears to Frodo in a flowing white gown with light radiating out from her. This is just a vision to Frodo but it symbolizes that she is good and is there to help him. Though she does warn him that she could end up evil and remain like she is .,,,,,,,,
Literal Cliffhanger, Gandalf clings to the broken edge of the Bridge of Khazad-Dûm before falling to his temporary death.,,,,,,,,
Literal Disarming," Aragorn does this to Lurtz, followed by stabbing him through the chest and finally decapitating him . Lurtz didn't die until that last one.",,,,,,,,
"Little ""No"""," Isildur gave one to Elrond during the Siege of Barad-dûr following his defeat of Sauron after Elrond demands that he destroy the Ring. In the present-day, Elrond tells Gandalf that it was this moment that caused him to lose his faith in Men.",,,,,,,,
Locked Out of the Loop," In contrast to the book (and despite Gandalf’s urgings), Frodo is not made privy to Bilbo's plans for his disappearing act during his 111st Birthday, or that he’s leaving the Shire. Downplayed with Gimli and Frodo's Mithril Coat (and one that was there in the original release, but which has since been retroactively confirmed by The Hobbit Film Trilogy ). Despite being the son of one of the members of the late Thorin Oakenshield’s Company, Gimli doesn’t know that Bilbo was gifted the Mithril Coat for his services during the Quest of Erebor; he only finds out when Gandalf mentions it during their trek through Moria. Either Glóin didn't know (which, given Bilbo was wearing it around Erebor, seems unlikely), or Glóin simply didn’t tell his son. Either way, the revelation's quite a surprise for Gimli. Related to the above example, nobody in the Fellowship is initially aware that Frodo brought Bilbo's Mithril Coat (let alone that he's wearing it); they don't find out until the clash in the Chamber of Mazarbul. That said, it’s hinted Gandalf suspects when he's discussing Mithril earlier (and notice he's also not that surprised when Frodo ""miraculously"" survives the cave troll’s spear thrust). Even before they hit Moria, it surely didn't escape Gandalf's notice that Bilbo bequeathed the Ring and Sting to his nephew, yet the third and final tool the old Hobbit had acquired during the Quest of Erebor was conspicuously absent.",,,,,,,,

Lodged-Blade Recycling," Aragorn impales the cave troll with a spear; the troll pulls it out and uses it to eventually stab Frodo, who only survives because of his mithril shirt. Lurtz pulls Aragorn's knife out and throws it back at him — but only after licking it .",,,,,,,,
licking it,Aragorn's knife out and throws it back at him — but only after licking it .,,,,,,,,
Manly Tears," Boromir 's Final Speech : Boromir : I would have gone with you to the end, my brother... my captain... my king. Galadriel's intense gaze reduces Boromir to tears, most likely because he knows that she knows that he will eventually betray the Fellowship.",,,,,,,,
Final Speech,"al Speech : Boromir : I would have gone with you to the end, my brother... my captain... my king.",,,,,,,,
Made of Incendium," The Ringwraiths will burst into flames if they come in contact with a fire source. Aragorn uses this to an incredibly effective degree when he lights up half of them and hurls the torch so hard that it embeds into one's face. Doesn't really seem to deter them for long, though.",,,,,,,,
Major Injury Underreaction," Boromir merely grunts, drops to his knees, then gets right back up and keeps fighting after being shot with an arrow. It's not until the third that he stays down, and even then he's more concerned about failing the Fellowship than the fact that he has three arrows sticking out of his chest. Bear in mind that the shafts of these arrows were themselves a full inch in diameter.",,,,,,,,
Man Hug," Frodo and Sam share a big, tearful hug after Sam risks drowning to accompany Frodo to Mordor.",,,,,,,,
Meaningful Background Event, You see the giant eagle behind Saruman right before Gandalf jumps from the tower of Orthanc.,,,,,,,,
Meaningful Echo," The tune from ""Concerning Hobbits"" (the piece that plays as the Shire is introduced) appears at the end of the movie in "" The Breaking of the Fellowship "".",,,,,,,,
Million Mook March," The army of the Last Alliance, as a flashback.",,,,,,,,
Miracle Food, Elven lembas bread (which got more emphasis in the original book) is featured in a scene from the Extended Edition DVD. Legolas explains to the hobbits Merry and Pippin that a single bite of lembas can fill a grown man's stomach for a day. As soon as Legolas leaves: Merry: How many did you eat? Pippin: Four. [groans],,,,,,,,
Mordor," The fearsome trope namer is described by Boromir with the following words: ""One does not simply walk into Mordor. Its black gates are guarded by more than just orcs. There is evil there that does not sleep, and the Great Eye is ever watchful. It is a barren wasteland, riddled with fire, ash, and dust. The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume. Not with ten thousand men could you do this. It is folly.""",,,,,,,,
Murder Water," The flash flood that Arwen summons to wash away the Nazgûl pursuing Frodo and the Ring is represented by a herd of watery horses charing down the river and sweeping the Nazgûl away, in a rare heroic version of this trope.",,,,,,,,
My New Gift Is Lame," Each member in the Fellowship receives cool personal gifts from Galadriel, including a magical lantern for Frodo, some daggers for Pippin and Merry, and a coveted lock of golden hair for Gimli. Sam, however, gets some rope. Visibly underwhelmed, he even has the balls to ask if he might have a ""shiny dagger"" as well, but Galadriel just smirks at his impudence and doesn't bother to reply. Of course, the rope magically unties itself when necessary, and comes in very useful . In the book, Sam is given a rare seed and fertile soil from Lothlórien due to his trade as a gardener. The rope is just part of the general equipment.",,,,,,,,
Mythology Gag, The scene angle when the Nazgûl are looking for the Hobbits hiding in a root is directly taken from the Ralph Bakshi animated version .,,,,,,,,
Myth Prologue," The film opens with the story of how the rings of power were forged (effectively introducing the races of Middle Earth in the process), how Sauron used the One Ring of Power to take over Middle Earth, how Isildur failed to destroy the ring once Sauron was defeated, and how millennia would pass before it was fished out of the water once again. Galadriel, narrating, mourns that there are so few still alive who were there to witness it. This is a deviation from the book, which opened on Bilbo's birthday in the Shire, and makes the mythic scope of the film more immediately obvious to audiences.",,,,,,,,
"""Nations of the World"" Montage", The shots of all of the free peoples of Middle-earth showing up for the Council of Elrond.,,,,,,,,
Natural Spotlight," A few scenes, like Balin's tomb which was described like this even in the original novel, explained by ingenious light channels carved by the dwarves in the mountainside. On the other hand, the one lighting Gollum's cave in the prologue comes off as highly improbable, considering its depth and the fact that Gollum can't stand daylight.",,,,,,,,
Never Found the Body," Gandalf's fall. He actually dies though, but not because of the fall, and, as he is a Maia (angelic spirit), he is brought Back from the Dead by his employers anyway.",,,,,,,,
Nightmare Face, When Bilbo wants to take a look at the One Ring. Holy crap !,,,,,,,,
"Nice Job Breaking It, Hero!"," Bilbo sharing his name and place of origin with Gollum during the Riddle Game back in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (and while it was there in 2001, it was more of an implication; it's clearer now with the Middle-earth films completed). This comment, given without thought and in passing 60 years earlier, finally comes back to bite the Baggins Family with a vengeance. Gollum is located and captured by Sauron's forces (and before Gandalf can get to him first) and tortured into divulging what he knows. This gives the Nazgûl their first real lead on the One Ring's whereabouts since Sauron's original downfall. And since Bilbo has left the Shire at this point, Frodo's left holding the bag (and the Ring) and forced to go on the run. Pippin's curiosity leading him to mess with a skeleton by a well in Moria, leading to the whole thing, chains and bucket and all, toppling in. Not only does this lead to them being attacked by a horde of goblins, it awakens the Balrog, and ultimately results in Gandalf's death.",,,,,,,,

O.O.C. Is Serious Business, A plot point. Bilbo’s uncharacteristic outburst and behavior when he leaves Bag End and initially refuses to relinquish the Ring alarms Gandalf. It’s what finally brings Gandalf's longstanding concerns to a head (along with his brief contact with Sauron’s presence) and prompts his fact-finding mission to Minas Tirith’s archives.,,,,,,,,
Offscreen Teleportation," Gandalf manages to move from Bilbo's party to Bag End before Bilbo himself gets there, even though he is seen sitting in the audience while Bilbo is running home, made invisible by the Ring. All without crossing paths with him, either. He is a wizard, but not even the most powerful beings in Middle-earth can manage actual teleportation.",,,,,,,,

These mighty Dúnedain have just mopped the floor with the Orcs and are about to declare their victory... then all of a sudden a black-armoured giant with a very big mace strides into their midst... Frodo in the first film, when he realizes that the two words Sauron's forces got from Gollum (Shire and Baggins) means that they know where the One Ring is and are coming to take it. Gandalf when Saruman informs him that now in knowledge of the One Ring's location, Sauron has dispatched some of his most lethal agents to get it back. Saruman: Sauron's forces are already moving. The Nine have left Minas Morgul. Gandalf: [horrified] The Nine ?! Also Gandalf's reaction when Saruman reveals he is in league with Sauron and bars the former's escape from Orthanc. During the Skirmish at Weathertop, Frodo hears Sauron's voice emanating from the Ring and is tempted to pull it out of his pocket. He immediately panics as he realizes he just confirmed to Sauron's forces that he has the Ring on him. note Remember, at that point the Nazgûl had no idea which of the four halflings they were pursuing out of Bree bore the name ""Baggins"" and whether they had taken the Ring with them or hidden it somewhere. When Arwen summons a tidal wave to beat the Nazgûl. Granted, they don't have faces, but their behaviour is enough to convey it. In Moria: Gandalf's reaction to hear Goblin drums beating, as the denizens of Moria have realised there are intruders in their home. Boromir's deadpan "" They have a cave troll ."" Spoken in an almost Graham Chapman voice. Legolas gets a pretty good Oh Crap look when he realizes there's a Balrog down there. The Moria Goblins are also similarly terrified. Elrond has an Oh Crap reaction to the fact that Saruman is breeding an Orc army of his own. An army that can move in sunlight. Aragorn and Legolas are busy fighting the Uruk-Hai on Amon Hen, when suddenly they hear the Horn of Gondor being blown frantically. ""Boromir!!!""",,,,,,,,
The Nine,"en Saruman informs him that now in knowledge of the One Ring's location, Sauron has dispatched some of his most lethal agents to get it back. Saruman: Sauron's forces are already moving. The Nine have left Minas Morgul. Gandalf: [horrified] The Nine ?!",,,,,,,,

They have a cave troll," have a cave troll ."" Spoken in an almost Graham Chapman voice.",,,,,,,,
An army that can move in sunlight.,e fact that Saruman is breeding an Orc army of his own. An army that can move in sunlight.,,,,,,,,
Onrushing Army, The prologue of the film features mindlessly rushing Orcs against more disciplined Elves.,,,,,,,,
Opening Monologue," Galadriel's now iconic opening monologue of the film, describing the forging of the Rings Of Power , the Battle of the Last Alliance, Sauron's downfall and the One Ring being lost and forgotten, basically laying the groundwork for the beginning of the main story. The page quote at the top is just part of it. She speaks some Elvish (Sindarin) at the beginning of the monologue. ""( I amar prestar aen. ) The world is changed. ( Han matho ne nen. ) I feel it in the water. ( Han mathon ned cae. ) I feel it in the earth. ( A han noston ned gwilith. ) I smell it in the air. Much that once was is lost, for none now live who remember it.""",,,,,,,,
Open Sesame," When the Fellowship tries to enter Moria through the enchanted gate that's inscribed ""Speak friend and enter"". Which actually TELLS you what to say.",,,,,,,,
Parrying Bullets," Aragorn performs an era-appropriate variation when he uses his sword to swat aside a knife flying towards his head. Impressively, there's no CGI involved in the stunt; Viggo Mortensen actually parried a knife accidentally thrown at his face by the other actor.",,,,,,,,
Patrick Stewart Speech," Boromir's speech to Aragorn, shortly before the Breaking of the Fellowship. Though not a straight subversion of this trope, the story demonstrates a few scenes later that the reality of human nature is uglier than Boromir's speech makes it out to be .",,,,,,,,
Phosphor-Essence, Galadriel glows with a bluish-white light when she explains how powerful and terrible she would become were she to accept the Ring.,,,,,,,,
Plummet Perspective, A torch is dropped by Boromir on the way to the Bridge of Khazad-dûm; he barely saves himself from following it.,,,,,,,,
Poor Communication Kills," Zigzagged when Gandalf realizes Gollum's followed them into Moria. He doesn't inform anyone else in the Fellowship for 3 days (likely because, given what else was down in Moria, an insane former Ringbearer was the least of their problems). If Frodo hadn’t spotted Gollum by chance and reported it, the Fellowship would’ve remained unaware they were being trailed (since Gandalf would have taken that knowledge with him when he falls into the chasm ). But because Frodo sounded the alarm, Aragorn’s now vigilant in the Extended Editon (and hoped they’d lose Gollum on the Anduin River). Frodo and Sam are also likewise now on their guard after they split off at the end of this film and this vigilance allows them to capture Gollum at the beginning of the next film .",,,,,,,,
Portal Statue Pairs," The Argonath, also known as the Gate of Kings or the Pillars of the Kings, was a landmark on the northern edge of Gondor in representing two of the earliest kings of Gondor.",,,,,,,,
Power Echoes," Gandalf's voice gets deep and echoes when he declares: "" BILBO BAGGINS — DO NOT TAKE ME FOR SOME CONJUROR OF CHEAP TRICKS!! I AM NOT TRYING TO ROB YOU! "" Also: "" YOU... SHALL NOT... PASS!!! ''"" Heard when Saruman is chanting the spell to ""bring down the mountain"" on the Fellowship in the Pass of Caradhras.",,,,,,,,
Power Glows," When Galadriel enters her wraith-like form, she emits a powerful white glow.",,,,,,,,
Pragmatic Adaptation, The removal of Tom Bombadil.,,,,,,,,
Pragmatic Villainy," Implied with Gollum when he’s following the Fellowship in Moria, then makes it out of the Mines and stays on their tail down the Anduin in the Extended Edition. Despite having Frodo in his sight, Gollum makes no move to reclaim his Precious in this film. The subtext is that even Gollum knows that trying to take the Ring from Frodo while he’s surrounded and protected by armed bodyguards is a bad idea. Gollum won’t make his play for the Ring until The Two Two Towers after Frodo is separated from the Fellowship at Amon Hen.",,,,,,,,
The Precarious Ledge," The Fellowships must traverse a narrow ledge at The Pass of Caradhras through the snow, even as Saruman tries to bring them down with his foul chanting.",,,,,,,,
Precision F-Strike," Implied when Gimli gets irritated with Haldir speaking Elvish with Aragorn and feeling left out of the convesation. Gimli shoots off an insult in Elvish, and whatever he said leaves Haldir fuming and Aragorn both embarrassed and pissed that the Dwarf is making his already-delicate negotiations even more difficult.",,,,,,,,
Pre-Explosion Glow," In the prologue, when his finger gets cut off, Sauron starts glowing from the inside before blowing up.",,,,,,,,
Prophecy Twist," Played with in the extended version. When Aragorn tells Frodo about the Story of Lúthien, who gave up her immortality to live a mortal life with the man she loved, Frodo asks him how it turned out. To which Aragorn simply replies ""She died.""",,,,,,,,
Punch! Punch! Punch! Uh Oh...," Hobbits attacking a cave troll should have this effect, but the scene is hardly played for laughs.",,,,,,,,
Punctuality Is for Peasants," When Gandalf the Grey meets up with Frodo Baggins on the way to attend the birthday party being thrown for Frodo's uncle Bilbo Baggins, Frodo accuses the wizard of being late, to which Gandalf retorts that he arrived when he planned to. Subverted and Played for Laughs , as Gandalf, who is a close friend of the Baggins, actually arrived just as the party was being set up, and both Frodo and Gandalf quickly break into laughter at the quip. Frodo: You're late! Gandalf: A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins. Nor is he early, he arrives precisely when he means to!",,,,,,,,
Punctuated!  For!  Emphasis!," ""You! Shall Not! Pass!"" . Then the bridge practically broke in half.",,,,,,,,
Pull Yourself Down the Spear," When Aragorn stabs Lurtz in the stomach, the Uruk-hai responds by pulling the sword inwards, snarling at Aragorn, possibly to get close enough to hurt him. Aragorn pulls the sword out and chops off Lurtz's head .",,,,,,,,
Radial Ass Kicking," The Balrog chases them off before the fight actually happens but in the Mines of Moria, the Fellowship finds itself completely surrounded by a really absurd number of goblins.",,,,,,,,
Rain of Arrows," The prologue sequence shows the Battle of Dagorlad, where the combined armies of the Elves and Númenóreans rain arrows down on the orcs of Mordor before Sauron himself takes to the field.",,,,,,,,
Rasputinian Death," Even after being shot with 3 arrows, Boromir puts up a fight before dying.",,,,,,,,
Reality Has No Subtitles," Depending on the circumstances, non-Common dialogue may or may not be subtitled. A notable example is Elrond shouting orders to his troops at the battle on Mount Doom.",,,,,,,,
Redemption Equals Death," Boromir's famous death scene happened right after he attacked Frodo, tried to take the ring from him, and cursed him along with ""all the halflings"". What was he doing during his death scene? Defending two of these ""Halflings"" with his life.",,,,,,,,
Red Filter of Doom," The filter is red owing to a fiery demon, the Balrog.",,,,,,,,
Reluctant Gift," The One Ring has this effect on its bearers. Bilbo Baggins has to be prompted into giving it up when Gandalf tells him, ""The Ring is still in your pocket.""",,,,,,,,
Reports of My Death Were Greatly Exaggerated, Sauron is Not Really Dead.,,,,,,,,
Reveal Shot," We open with a shot of a dark menacing tower in Mordor, apparently Barad-dûr, home of Sauron. Then the camera pulls back... and back... and back... until we are able to get a full view of the ungodly immense, dozens of times larger and infinitely more menacing tower that is the true Barad-dûr, revealing the initial tower we saw as one of the hundreds of (relatively) tiny lookout towers spaced around Barad-dûr's outer wall.",,,,,,,,
Ridiculously Difficult Route," Whether passing over (Caradhras) or under (Moria), the Misty Mountains is this trope for the Fellowship.",,,,,,,,
Roaring Rampage of Revenge," Merry and Pippin do this twice. When the cave-troll seems to have killed Frodo, they share a look and then leap onto its back, stabbing it repeatedly. (Their small blades affect it little, but Pippin is able to time one final strike so that it rears its head back and allow Legolas to deliver the fatal shot through the throat). The second comes after Boromir falls to his knees for the last time—Merry raises his sword and screams, followed by Pippin, and they rush the Uruk-hai—only to be effortlessly grabbed and carried away.",,,,,,,,
Rookie Red Ranger," The Hobbits as a whole serve at this, especially during their initial flight to Rivendell. They are clearly scared but also don't come even close to grasping how serious a situation they are in, with Aragorn even scoffing at Frodo that he is not nearly scared enough for how serious the situation is - although Frodo does learn much faster then the others. Exemplified by Frodo waking up because the other Hobbits seem to think they are just on a fun camping trip and lit a campfire to cook a nice hot meal on a peak that can be seen for dozens of miles while they are being hunted. And being very annoyed at Frodo frantically putting the fire out and calling them fools ... until two seconds later when the Nazgûl make it clear Frodo had every right be to somewhat alarmed at their decision making...",,,,,,,,
Role-Playing Game 'Verse," An Unbuilt Trope . The book series itself predates role-playing games like D&D and in fact codified many High Fantasy tropes. However, after the Fellowship is formed and before it is disbanded, the plot and characters would fit right into an RPG verse: a party that includes a wizard, an elf, a dwarf, a knight, and a ranger set out on a dangerous journey to destroy an Artifact of Doom , facing many typical genre perils like monsters, bands of orcs, and evil sorcerers trying to thwart their progress. The second and third films avert this, being closer to epic war movies.",,,,,,,,
Romantic Ribbing," Downplayed example. In a Film-only scene, Aragorn finds a blade to his throat while looking for althelas, aka, kingsfoil. Then he hears a familiar feminine voice playfully ask: Arwen: What's this; a Ranger caught off his guard?",,,,,,,,
Rule of Symbolism," Christian symbolism is carried over from the books, although in a very discreet manner : When the Fellowship parts from Lothlorien, a white-clad Galadriel makes a blessing gesture ◊ , looking much like Catholic statues of Virgin Mary. They even used a statue of Mary as a stand-in at the tomb of Aragorn's mother. Jackson bows to Tolkien with subtle grace: the film opens in total darkness, and the voice of Cate Blanchett begins to speak... in Elvish. Because with Tolkien the languages came first, and then the people who spoke them, and their stories. In the beginning was the word...",,,,,,,,
Run or Die," The goblin horde in Moria, but especially the Balrog.",,,,,,,,
Sad Battle Music, There are two uses of this trope in the film. The first is when they escape the mines of Moria right after Gandalf falls. The second is when Boromir is slain fighting the orcs.,,,,,,,,
Scare Chord, When Gandalf almost touches the One Ring and senses Sauron in it. When Bilbo sees the Ring around Frodo's neck in Rivendell.,,,,,,,,
Scared of What's Behind You," In Moria, Gimli thinks that the Fellowship is scaring off the orcs, naturally it's the Balrog that they're really reacting to.",,,,,,,,
Scary Impractical Armour," Sauron, and a few other bad guys, wear some pretty intense armour.",,,,,,,,
Scary Symbolic Shapeshifting," Bilbo Baggins is normally a genial old hobbit, and even his many decades of subtle corruption by the One Ring seems to be little more than a blip on the radar by the time he turns up at Rivendell. However, while the Fellowship is preparing to leave Rivendell, he happens to catch sight of the Ring on Frodo — and suddenly lunges wildly at him, sporting sharp teeth and enormous, frenzied-looking eyes. Bilbo demonstrates no shapeshifting at any other point in the story, so this is just an indication that the Ring still has its hooks in him and could one day drag him down to the same level as Gollum .",,,,,,,,
Scene of Wonder," The journey through Moria is mostly dark and depressing, but when they reach Dwarrowdelf, Gandalf considers it worth risking more light to let the Fellowship see the city-sized cave and supporting pillars.",,,,,,,,
Scenery Gorn," The film is made of Scenery Porn during the ""good times"" parts, and Scenery Gorn during the ""struggling times"" parts. The best example is probably the view of the ruination of the Shire in the Mirror of Galadriel note the actual canon Scouring of the Shire was cut from the films, so this was Jackson's way of wedging it in . As Sam and Frodo say in the books, seeing your own home devastated when you remember it being pleasant is far more horrifying than some anonymous landscape that you never knew before it was ruined.",,,,,,,,
Sequel Hook," A particularly nasty yet uplifting one. Immediately following Boromir's fall, Frodo and Sam trudge off on their own path while Merry and Pippin were plucked away by the Uruk-hai in the final battle, leaving Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli to start the hunt to save the latter pair of Hobbits while the former head into Mordor all by themselves. As the establishing part of the trilogy, cue the credits and, at the time of release, waiting until next year or reading the book to see what happened next.",,,,,,,,
Shaping Your Attacks, The Balrog seemingly made his sword and whip out of pure fire. In the book they're simply described as fiery weapons .,,,,,,,,
Shield Bash, The Uruk-Hai captain tried to use his shield against Aragorn in the final battle.,,,,,,,,
Shot/Reverse Shot," The movie gets across Galadriel's ability to see into the Fellowship's mind by cutting between an Extreme Close-Up of her eyes and then a member of the Fellowship. This goes on for each of them until we cut back to her from Frodo's face, when we hear her speaking telepathically into her mind.",,,,,,,,
Shout-Out," To the Ralph Bakshi animated Lord Of The Rings (Mr. Proudfoot the Hobbit with his feet up on the table, and the Nazgûl emerging from the tree as the four Hobbits hide in the roots); to The Wizard of Oz (Frodo, Sam and Gollum, on the cliff above the Black Gate, watch the Easterlings march in with their weird chant note Jackson confirmed this was deliberate ); Shaka Zulu (the pre-Battle Of Helms Deep build-up), Gladiator (Aragorn's dazed horse ride to Helm's Deep; Frodo being carried by the Eagles), and possibly The Wheel of Time ; ""History became legend. Legend became myth "" During the duel between Aragorn and Lurtz, Aragorn stabs Lurtz through the leg with his dagger, and it gets stuck there until Lurtz pulls it out and tosses it back at him. A similar scene happens in Friday the 13th Part III , when Chris attacks Jason with a knife.",,,,,,,,

Shouting Free-for-All," During the Council of Elrond, after the impossibility of the task before them is laid out, the council jumps to to their feet all yelling and shouting at each other, with the exception of Frodo, who sits to the side staring at the One Ring until he gets up and offers to take it to Mordor himself.",,,,,,,,
Simple Solution Won't Work," When Elrond and Frodo reveal the One Ring to the attendees of the Council of Rivendell, Boromir suggests using the Ring against Sauron. Aragorn immediately shoots that down: ""The One Ring answers to Sauron alone. It has no other master."" Elrond subsequently says that the Ring must be destroyed. Gimli promptly takes a swing at it with his battleaxe — and is Blown Across the Room and his axe's blade shattered . Elrond: [bemused] The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Glóin, by any craft that we here possess.",,,,,,,,
Blown Across the Room,"s that the Ring must be destroyed. Gimli promptly takes a swing at it with his battleaxe — and is Blown Across the Room and his axe's blade shattered . Elrond: [bemused] The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Glóin, by any craft that we here possess.",,,,,,,,
Single Tear," After Gandalf dies, Frodo drops a tear. So does Aragorn when Boromir dies; Manly Tears , indeed.",,,,,,,,
Slippery MacGuffin," The One Ring somehow slips away from Frodo in the avalanche on Caradhras. This is physically impossible because the Ring was not in his pocket, but carried on a chain around his neck, and the chain is intact when Boromir picks up the Ring — but the Ring, being magic, does it anyway . It calls to the Nazgûl every time one is near.",,,,,,,,
Slow-Motion Fall," Done with Boromir at the end of the movie. When the first arrow hits him, he staggers and falls slowly to his knees... but, since this is his Dying Moment of Awesome , he stands back up and keeps fighting while the scene remains in slow motion. It's repeated when he's hit by a second arrow, falls, and stands again, but the third arrow finishes it. The scene returns to normal speed when Aragorn crashes into the Uruk-Hai archer.",,,,,,,,
Solemn Ending Theme," Enya's ""May It Be"" , which has a (relatively) hopeful, hymnlike quality.",,,,,,,,
Solo Mission Becomes Group Mission," Despite Frodo insisting to go alone in his mission, Sam ends up going with him: Frodo: Go back, Sam! I'm going to Mordor alone. Sam: Of course you are, and I'm coming with you!",,,,,,,,
Soul Jar," The One Ring. It wasn't actually created for this purpose — the Dark Lord Sauron was already an immortal spirit able to take any form he wished. He created it as an Amplifier Artifact that would make his already formidable Mind Control powers strong enough to take over the other rings (and through them, their wearers). But in making the Ring strong enough to control the other rings he had to put so much of his Life Energy into it that as long as the Ring survives he cannot be completely destroyed either. Frodo: But he was destroyed. Sauron was destroyed. Gandalf: No, Frodo. The spirit of Sauron endured. His life force is bound to the Ring, and the Ring survived. Sauron has returned.",,,,,,,,
Speak Friend and Enter," The Trope Namer, like the book. Gandalf spends hours casting opening spells and trying passwords on the door into Moria. He finally realizes that he mistranslated the inscription on the door: instead of ""Speak, friend, and enter"", it was ""Say 'friend' and enter"". All he had to do was say the elven word for ""friend"" and the door opened. Gandalf read the inscription aloud before, but in the common tongue, not in Elvish. He notes that the doors were made when trade between Moria and neighbouring Eregion was plentiful, and the dwarves of Moria would have little reason to close the gates, especially not to elves. The late third age, however, is far more dangerous, and people are more suspicious. Frodo: It's a riddle. ""Speak friend and enter."" What's the Elvish word for friend? Gandalf: Mellon . [door opens]",,,,,,,,
Stealth Pun," At the Prancing Pony, Merry comes back to the Hobbits' table looking pleased with himself, carrying a mug of ale that dwarfs (*ahem*) the others'. ""This, my friend,"" he tells Pippin, ""is a pint ."" ""They come in pints ?"" asks a bewildered Pippin, before adding, ""I'm getting one."" What were the Hobbits drinking up to that point? Half-pints . Gimli's cousin, Balin, calls Moria, a dwarven mine and his (Balin's) own kingdom, a mine. A mine , get it?",,,,,,,,
Steel Mill," Saruman runs one at the basement of Isengard. The scene was filmed in a real foundry, using real steelworkers using Orc costumes.",,,,,,,,
Stern Chase," The Nazgûl. ""They will never stop hunting you.""",,,,,,,,
Storyboarding the Apocalypse, Galadriel shows Frodo a vision of The Shire as an industrial work camp. In the book it turns out she was bang on; in the following movies Saruman gets shanked early and that side of the conflict ends.,,,,,,,,
"Suicidal ""Gotcha!"""," Gandalf jumps off the top of Isengard and landing on Gwaihir, Lord of the Eagles, who he had previously requested aid from via a passing moth.",,,,,,,,
Supernatural Language," When Gandalf reads the inscription on the One Ring in Black Speech , his voice becomes inhumanely deep, resonant and guttural, and the light seems to recede as he speaks. Frodo and the elven nobility recoil in pain as they hear it.",,,,,,,,
Surprisingly Super-Tough Thing," Gimli, during the Council of Elrond, blithely declares, after Elrond states that the One Ring must be destroyed, ""What are we waiting for!"" and proceeds to try to cut it in half with one of his axes, which promptly shatters, leaving the Ring completely unscathed. Elrond then chastises him for his ignorance.",,,,,,,,
Sword Fight," First, Aragorn fighting the Ringwraiths off with a sword in one hand and a torch in the other. Second, Aragorn fighting the leader of the Uruk-Hai.",,,,,,,,
Symbolic Serene Submersion," At the end of the movie, Sam follows Frodo's boat into the water despite being unable to swim, desperate to remain by his side. When he inevitably goes underwater, he flails at first, but then he goes limp and his face assumes a serene expression, demonstrating his willingness to die for Frodo (who saves him, of course).",,,,,,,,
Tae Kwon Door," When the Nazgûl burst into Bree, the terrified door guard looks through the door, and gets it slammed off its hinges, on top of him.",,,,,,,,
Take a Moment to Catch Your Death," After he watches the Balrog fall through the pit of Khazad-dûm, Gandalf turns away from the lip of the broken bridge. Unfortunately, the Balrog manages to lasso Gandalf's foot as it falls, pulling Gandalf until he is dangling from the lip by his weak grasp. Certain that any attempt to recover would hinder the Fellowship, he bids them to escape the mine and lets go .",,,,,,,,
Take It to the Bridge, Arwen gives the Evenstar to Aragorn on an obviously symbolic bridge.,,,,,,,,
Take My Hand!, Frodo saves Sam from drowning by pulling him up by his wrist.,,,,,,,,
Taking You with Me," There are quite a few examples of this trope in the film: In the prologue, we see Sauron explode once the Ring is severed from his hand. Though this may be subverted as the affected scores of Men and Elves were more likely blown off of their feet than killed. The Balrog pulls Gandalf down the dark chasm with its fiery whip as it falls. Boromir takes down many Uruk-Hai as he is being pierced by Lurtz' arrows.",,,,,,,,
The Team," The Fellowship of the Ring, which was formed for the purpose of destroying the One Ring by going into the deepest parts of Mordor and casting it into the volcanic fires of Mount Doom, where it was originally forged.",,,,,,,,
Technicolor Death," Although it's right in the prologue rather than the end of the movie, death for Sauron basically means becoming the exploding man.",,,,,,,,
Telepathy," Galadriel, Elrond and Gandalf are shown communicating telepathically with each other. Galadriel also speaks to Frodo in his mind in Lothlórien and at various points in his journey to Mordor.",,,,,,,,
Tempting Fate," Played for Laughs . When Sam panics after losing sight of him for a moment, Frodo asks in amusement what could happen while they're still in the Shire. A second later, Merry and Pippin bowl them over.",,,,,,,,
That Was the Last Entry," The dwarven log in the Mines of Moria. ""They have taken the bridge and the second hall. We have barred the gates but cannot hold them for long. The ground shakes, drums... drums in the deep. We cannot get out. A shadow lurks in the dark. We cannot get out... they are coming ."" It's written neatly in dwarven runes except for the last three words, scribbled hastily in Elvish cursive.",,,,,,,,
This Is as Far as I Go," Inverted when The Hero , Frodo, chooses to go on alone into Mordor, although his far more experienced companions would willingly have gone with him. Aragorn: [to Frodo] I would have gone with you to the end. Into the very fires of Mordor. Frodo: I know. Also when the hobbits are leaving the Shire, Samwise stops and says, ""This is it..."" then follows up with, ""If I take one more step, it'll be the farthest away from home I've ever been."" (which inspires the question of how he knew that, given that he was in the middle of a field at the time), and proceeds to stay with Frodo throughout the rest of the story.",,,,,,,,
The Hero,"hen The Hero , Frodo, chooses to go on alone into Mordor, although his far more experienced companions would willingly have gone with him. Aragorn: [to Frodo] I would have gone with you to the end. Into the very fires of Mordor. Frodo: I know.",,,,,,,,
This Is Gonna Suck," ""They have a cave troll.""",,,,,,,,
This Way to Certain Death," The movie makes it clear to the audience (and most of the characters) that something very bad has happened in Moria with skeletons sprawled on the floor everywhere not far from the entrance. Gimli, however, remains steadfast in his denial until confronted with an actual written account of the bloodbath.",,,,,,,,
Throat Light," The Balrog has light pouring out of its gullet. It is also glowing from various cracks in its skin, the implication being that it is simply a giant flame in demonic form cloaked by shadow.",,,,,,,,
Throwing the Distraction," Frodo, Merry, Pippin and Sam are hiding from a black rider (Nazgûl/Ringwraith) under some tree roots. As the rider is peering overhead, and it seems they are close to being discovered, Merry throws his and Pippin's sack of (stolen) vegetables, which gives the four of them enough time to escape the scene.",,,,,,,,
Throwing Your Shield Always Works," Lurtz throws his shield at Aragorn during the skirmish at Amon Hen, pinning him to a tree. Aragorn gets free of the shield just in time to dodge another attack.",,,,,,,,
Throwing Your Sword Always Works," Aragorn throws his sword into an Orc during the battle in Balin's tomb. Gimli carries at least a couple throwing axes, which he uses to kill an Uruk-hai when he joins the fight at Amon Hen. Boromir kills an Uruk-hai with a thrown knife to the throat at the beginning of his Last Stand .",,,,,,,,
Last Stand,s an Uruk-hai with a thrown knife to the throat at the beginning of his Last Stand .,,,,,,,,
Thwarted Coup de Grâce," Lurtz, the head Uruk-Hai, has shot Boromir full of holes and is ready to deliver the killing shot when Aragorn leaps in and kills Lurtz. This gives Boromir enough time to deliver his dying speech. Aragorn is knocked flat by an Uruk getting impaled on (thereby trapping) his sword; Gimli and Legolas arrive before the rest of the orcs can take advantage of the situation. Then Boromir himself pulls a Big Damn Heroes when a group of Uruks charge at Merry and Pippin; one has his axe raised to do Pippin in when Boromir arrives from offscreen to deflect the blow.",,,,,,,,

Tightrope Walking, Legolas goes running along a chain to attack the cave troll.,,,,,,,,
Title Drop," ""You shall be the Fellowship of the Ring ."" The names of chapters from The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings are brought up on occasion. On entering Hobbiton, Gandalf is delighted to see preparations underway for A Long-Expected Party . When Lobelia Sackville-Baggins comes knocking on the front door of Bag End, Bilbo whispers to Gandalf ""I am not at home !"". Gandalf whispers Riddles in the Dark, as he wonders if that chapter of The Hobbit might not be entirely true. ""There is only one Lord of the Ring , only one who can bend it to his will. And he does not share power!"" When the hobbits fall on each other after being pursued by Farmer Maggot "" A shortcut to what ?"" "" Mushrooms !""",,,,,,,,

Tragic Hero," Boromir, whose desire to protect his people at all costs makes him easy prey for the power of the Ring.",,,,,,,,
Uncommon Time," The Uruk-Hai theme from Howard Shore's score, heard most prominently in the track ""Amon Hen"" on this film's OST, has 5/4 time. Shore explained that he was aiming to give Saruman's army a mechanical-sounding accompaniment.",,,,,,,,
Undeathly Pallor," In the film commentary, Peter Jackson discusses how Boromir's skin was paled just a little bit at the moment he succumbs to his wounds and dies. The change is so subtle that most viewers might not consciously pick it up, yet still provides his death scene a little extra punch.",,,,,,,,
Unnecessarily Large Interior," The dwarven city of Khazad-dûm seems to consist of huge empty spaces with free-standing stairs on the edges and straight across. The book has mostly corridors and normal-sized rooms, with a few great halls. The giant halls also prove to be a major issue when the dwarves unleash an Eldritch Abomination : the Balrog. The great halls allow it to move about with relative ease, seeing as how it's twenty times bigger than the whole Fellowship put together.",,,,,,,,
Eldritch Abomination,"rove to be a major issue when the dwarves unleash an Eldritch Abomination : the Balrog. The great halls allow it to move about with relative ease, seeing as how it's twenty times bigger than the whole Fellowship put together.",,,,,,,,
Unsafe Haven," Invoked as a shortcut to explain why the One Ring cannot just stay in Rivendell. Throughout the first part of the film the hobbits — and us — are led to believe that ""the Ring will be safe in Rivendell"" — until Elrond tells Gandalf otherwise. This is only in the film as a drama-preserving handicap for the sake of maintaining tension. In the books, and for the attentive viewer , Rivendell is obviously not the final destination...",,,,,,,,
Untouchable Until Tagged," Boromir was on a rip-roaring Orc-slaying binge until a single arrow hits him, which was enough to get him mobbed and killed, although it took another couple of arrows to fully incapacitate him.",,,,,,,,
Vertigo Effect, Used by Peter Jackson when Frodo senses the arrival of the Black Rider in the Shire.,,,,,,,,
Viking Funeral, One of the last scenes shows Boromir's body laid out in a boat and drifting over the waterfall of the Anduin.,,,,,,,,
Voice of the Legion, Galadriel gets a bit of this when she goes off on a tangent while being tempted by the Ring.,,,,,,,,
Wait Here," At Weathertop, Aragorn says he's going to have a look around and for the hobbits to ""stay here."" Naturally it doesn't work out exactly as planned.",,,,,,,,
War Comes Home," Discussed Trope . Near the end of the movie, the Elf queen Galadriel has Frodo stare into a mirror in which he sees his homeland, the Shire invaded by orcs and the hobbits carried off in chains. Galadriel informs him that this is a prophetic vision of what will come to pass if Frodo fails in his mission to destroy the ring.",,,,,,,,
Warts and All," Invoked in Boromir's nighttime argument with Aragorn in the Extended Edition, berating Aragorn for his lack of faith in Men. Boromir: Have you so little faith in your own people? Yes, there is weakness. There is frailty. But there is courage also, and honor to be found in Men. But you will not see that. You are afraid! All your life, you have hidden in the shadows! Scared of who you are, of what you are.",,,,,,,,
War Was Beginning, The movie starts with Galadriel narrating a history lesson about Sauron.,,,,,,,,
Weapon Chooses the Wielder," Explicitly stated during the Council of Elrond referring to the One Ring. Boromir: Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy. Let us use it against him! Aragorn: You cannot wield it, none of us can. The One Ring answers to Sauron alone. It has no other master.",,,,,,,,
Weapon Stomp," King Elendil's sword is shattered when Sauron steps on it. In a subversion of the trope, Isildur uses the shattered blade to cut Sauron's fingers (and thus separated him from the ring).",,,,,,,,
Weapon Twirling, Boromir twirls his sword a few times while waiting for the goblin horde to break into Balin's Tomb in Moria.,,,,,,,,
We ARE Struggling Together," During the Council at Rivendell, no one can agree on anything. Elrond wants to destroy the Ring, Boromir wants to use the Ring to help Gondor, Gimli doesn't trust the elves and it isn't long before everyone starts arguing with each other and even Gandalf is yelling. And it's because the Ring is deliberately sowing distrust and chaos. But as soon as Frodo, despite being terrified and overwhelmed, declares he will take the Ring to Mordor, the one thing that all these seasoned warriors unanimously agree upon is that this little brave hobbit must be protected.",,,,,,,,
We Can Rule Together, Saruman tries this on Gandalf. It doesn't work.,,,,,,,,
We Need a Distraction," When Merry and Pippin realize that Frodo's leaving the Fellowship at Amon Hen, they create a distraction so he can escape.",,,,,,,,
Wham Line," After informing Gandalf that Sauron's forces are on the move and that the Ring-Bearer is in danger, Saruman reveals his true allegiance: Saruman: You did not seriously believe a Hobbit could contest with the will of Sauron? There are none who can .",,,,,,,,
"What the Hell, Hero?"," Legolas and Boromir to Aragorn when he tells everyone to get up and moving after Gandalf's death. Legolas gives Aragorn a look that basically says ""Seriously, dude!?!"" while Boromir says ""Give them a moment, for pity's sake!""",,,,,,,,
Wings Do Nothing," The movie indeed depicts the Balrog with wings. However, they're skeletal, membrane-less wings that are completely useless for flight, explaining why the Balrog simply didn't fly away.",,,,,,,,
Wizard Duel," Gandalf versus Saruman. Does not happen in the book , though he does battle the Witch King (to a draw) on Weathertop in Fellowship of the Ring , seen from afar by the hobbits. Gandalf versus the Balrog is at least implied in the first film. DOES happen in the book in which an exhausted Gandalf states that he put a shutting-spell on the door. In the film the Balrog apparently can't follow them directly and takes another path, rather shaking things up as he does, implying that Gandalf (who does look pretty haggard by then) did something to impede him.",,,,,,,,

Wrongfully Attributed," The now famous line, ""A wizard is never late, nor is he early, he arrives precisely when he means to,"" was first uttered here. Somehow, however, the line keeps being referenced as a genuine quote from the books by casual fans of the 'verse.",,,,,,,,
Your Princess Is in Another Castle!," Frodo and Sam initially think their journey is over after they get the Ring to Rivendell for safekeeping at around halfway through the movie. Unfortunately, Elrond realizes that they cannot keep it there, and Frodo accepts the task of destroying it. Another moment occurs after the council of Elrond, when the Fellowship is formed. The nine stand in a pretty line, Elrond pronounces ""you shall be the Fellowship... of the Ring!"", the theme swells and half the audience start to retrieve coats, finish off drinks and generally make ready to leave. Then find out there's another hour and a half to go. And, in some cases, hadn't realised that even then there were two more films before ring meets lava. Also, Sam thinks his journey is over when the fellowship reaches Redhorn Mountain, which he confuses with Mount Doom. Not that it isn't a mountain of doom by itself.",,,,,,,,
You Shall Not Pass!," The Trope Namer , since Gandalf actually says ""You cannot pass"" in the book. He says both in the film, but the long, more meme-inducing one was ""shall not."" The entire final battle between the Fellowship and the Uruk-hai is another example, as the Fellowship attempts to buy time so Frodo can escape.",,,,,,,,
